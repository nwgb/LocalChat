# LocalChat

A simple local chat Minecraft Bukkit plugin. Messages sent with LocalChat are only visibile to nearby players.

## Usage
The maximum distance that players can receive local messages from is dependent on `view-distance` in server.properties.

### Send LocalChat message
`/local (message)` or `/l (message)`

Send a message locally

### Toggle LocalChat

`/localtoggle`

Toggle LocalChat. If toggled on, all messages sent will be sent locally (without needing to use `/local`)
